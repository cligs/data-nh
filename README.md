Data accompanying the dissertation __Genre analysis and corpus design: 19th century Spanish American novels (1830-1910)__ by Ulrike Henny-Krahmer

Links to the data contained in this repository are given in the text of the dissertation. This repository holds research data that resulted from applying the scripts of scripts-nh (see below) to the corpus files (see below) and is related to the following other GitHub repositories:

* [scripts-nh](https://github.com/cligs/scripts-nh/): XSLT- and Python scripts which were used for the creation, annotation, and documentation of the corpus and for the analysis of the novels in the corpus. The data resulting from the application of the scripts is stored in the present repository "data-nh".
* [Conha19: Corpus de novelas hispanoamericanas del siglo XIX](https://github.com/cligs/conha19): a corpus of 256 novels from Argentina, Cuba, and Mexico which were published between 1830 and 1910. 234 of the 256 novels are in the open domain and offered in the repository. This corpus is the data basis on which the novels and subgenres were analyzed.
* [Bib-ACMé: Bibliografía digital de novelas argentinas, cubanas y mexicanas (1830-1910)](https://github.com/cligs/bibacme): a digital bibliography of Argentine, Mexican, and Cuban novels published between 1830 and 1910. This bibliography constitutes the sampling frame for the corpus Conha19, so it aims to represent the whole population of 19th-century novels published in the three countries.
